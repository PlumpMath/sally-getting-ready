There are a lot of scholarship, you just have to find how to get the most from them. This is a very tricly part because sometimes you need to apply very early.

* Most of time, students from NCTU don't have a lot of technical lessons in Isep. If you choose to attend French lessons, you could get scholarship from French Cultural Service or even maybe from TW Fu Jen University.

You can also apply for other scholarships from the Ministry of Education of the Taiwanese government.
