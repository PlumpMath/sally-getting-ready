* It's strongly advised by any country that you ought have a repatriation insurance. I don't know how much it costs, it's Taiwanese business ;-)
* In France, I believe you can get healed for free because of welfare state. I can ask further if you want.
* This page deals very well with this topic http://www.campusfrance.org/en/page/frances-health-care-system. To make it short you have to pay French social security for students. Albeit you have to pay, you can get some allowance to reduce the cost. Check here : http://www.cmu.fr/ in French.
