Flight round-trip ticket
########################

* Applying for Visa. Go to this site : http://www.boca.gov.tw/content?mp=1&CuItem=1335 I'm not sure to understand perfectly but it may be helpful for you.
* Usually cheaper to book as early as possible. Take care, booking companies can be tricky and somewhat dishonest. For your information, I feel like you shouldn't spend more than â‚¬700 for a round trip ticket.
* Be very careful about luggage weight, it's tricky. When I travelled, I was allow to bring 20 kg from France to Taiwan and 23 from Taiwan to France then you will have the reversed weights :/
