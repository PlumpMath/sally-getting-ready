# Transportation

* From the airport: all your French friends will help you for sure! Welcome!
* You have two options: a yearly subscription gives you a card for unlimited rides and one-shot tickets give you just a ride.
 * The card costs €36 per month, you have to pay for a whole year in one shot. However, as you will leave France six months later, you can terminate the subscription and get paid back with money from remaining months.
 * Tickets are €1.30 each. As you would become an average Paris citizen for half a year, the card would be way cheaper. Tickets are OK for tourists.
