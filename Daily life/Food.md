# Food

* Weekly food: I usually spend around €40 for food weekly when I go to the supermarket.
* Daily food: in addition to the amount I spend weekly, I usually buy some sandwich for lunch when I have no time to cook it. You can find an average student-targeted menu (sandwich+drink) for six euros and a half.
* From a global viewpoint, each month you can live with €230 for food and few other goods (washing products, tooth paste…).
* A rice cooker costs around €20.
* Restaurant. You can find casual, affordable restaurant from €15 but most of restaurant starts from €20. There is no top limit, some restaurant are very expensive, more than €400 per capita :/
