# Housing

* Cité internationale universitaire. It's a big residence for foreigner. Monthly rental therein is less than €600, average rental is by €450. To apply here, it's mandatory to get admitted to Master degree lessons or higher. Actually, you are enrolled in Master lessons in Isep so it's good for you.
* Getting help from Isep. Our school has a website wherein it share affordable accomodations or room. By affordable, it means €600 per month. Some crazy people also put a €1700-per-month flat right in Paris. Fool thou art, which student could afford it.
* You can get monthly allowance up to €95 per month from the CAF just by asking them (it's a French welfare entity).
