## About that repository

I know it could look weird to set up a git repository just for 1 sheet of paper~ Anyway, this is not a world-wide-aiming repository, just a useful way to put a humble document on line and get some version control on it. Moreover it's easier than sending you mail because it keeps all information in the same place.

In another way, it may also be useful to any wondering people who meanders untill here, searching for information about France stay.

Anybody can propose text modification with a pull request but unfortunately must be reviewed prior to text update : this is a git limitation, sorry for that.

## How to use this repository

Just read text. Each file above is a different topic. I agree it would be easier to use keyword.

## Misc information

It's very easy to modify and format text here. It uses Markdown formatting system. If you want to correct a mistake, create a github account (it's free) and correct it online. Actually I've thought about using gh-pages with tags, categories and so on but would this humble page be worth of such technical wandering? ~~~
