## About that repository

I know it could look weird to set up a git repository just for 1 sheet of paper~ Anyway, this is not a world-wide-aiming repository, just a useful way to put a humble document on line and get some version control on it. Moreover it's easier than sending you mail because it keeps all information in the same place.

In another way, it may also be useful to any wondering people who meanders untill here, searching for information about France stay.

Anybody can propose text modification with a pull request but unfortunately must be reviewed prior to text update : this is a git limitation.

## How to use this repository

Just read text

## Misc information
